# 3D Raytracing on Intel i9: A Comparative Exploration

This repository contains four distinct C implementations of a 3D raytracing scene generator, each optimized specifically for the Intel i9 CPU and designed to output the result as a PPM file. These implementations were generated using four different large language models (LLMs):

## Overview

The project was initiated to compare how different LLMs approach the same programming challenge. Each script demonstrates unique coding styles, optimization techniques, and problem-solving strategies as interpreted by its respective model.

## What's Inside

- **`claude.c`**: The version generated by Claude Sonnet 3.5.
- **`grok.c`**: The version generated by Grok-2.
- **`gpt.c`**: The version generated by o3-mini, with Reason.
- **`deepseek.c`**: The version generated by deepseek R1, with DeepThink.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code**  
   Each C file can be compiled using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) optimized for the Intel i9 architecture:
   ```bash
   gcc -O2 -march=native -o raytracer <filename>.c
   ```
2. **Run the Executable**  
   Execute the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./raytracer
   ```
3. **View the Output**  
   The program will generate a PPM file containing the rendered 3D raytracing scene.
